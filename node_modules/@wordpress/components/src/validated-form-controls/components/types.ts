	 * This means the custom validator will be run _in addition_ to any other HTML attribute-based validation, and
	 * will be prioritized over any existing validity messages dictated by the HTML attributes.
	 * An empty string or `undefined` return value will clear any existing custom validity message.
	 *
	 * Make sure you don't programatically pass a value (such as an initial value) to the control component
	 * that fails this validator, because the validator will only run for user-initiated changes.
	 *
	 * Always prefer using standard HTML attributes like `required` and `min`/`max` over custom validators
	 * when possible, as they are simpler and have localized error messages built in.
